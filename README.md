# AEC SIGCOMM Review Template

The ACM SIGCOMM community showed to be sensible to artifacts availability and research reproducibility.

ACM has created a [Badging System](https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/artifact-review-badging) to assess the quality of these artifacts, the [ACM SIGCOMM Artifacts Evaluation Committee](https://www.sigcomm.org/content/sigcomm-artifacts-evaluation-committee) evaluates the artifacts proposed in ACM SIGCOMM Sponsored papers.

Reviewing an artefact is slightly different than reviewing a paper. To this end a review template has been developped.
