       <h3><li> What is the degree of efforts to obtain the artefact?</h3>
         Rate from 0% to 100%, where 0% means NOT AVAILABLE; 10%, VERY HARD TO OBTAIN up to 100% meaning VERY EASY TO OBTAIN.

       <h3><li>Comment about the degree of efforts to obtain the artefact:</h3> E.g., did the paper have explicit pointer to the artefact? The artefact is simply not available. I need to register to obtain the artefact. The artefact is a testbed and I cannot use it. The artefact is actually hardware, I cannot obtain it. The artefact is licensed and I should pay...

       <h3><li>Do you consider that the nature of the artefact (or any component of it) may raise (non-technical) issues? Of which Nature? </h3>
         E.g., ethical issues; non FRAND - Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory - licenses; environmental issues; safety issues;...

       <h3><li>In relation to the previous point, how long do you expect or estimate the artefact will be available:</h3>
         <form action="">
               <input type="radio" name="duration" value="less1">Less than 1 year<br>
               <input type="radio" name="duration" value="2to5"> Between 2 and 5 years<br>

<h2>Completeness of the Information</h2>

<ol>
  <h3><li>Are the instructions on how to install and make the artefact functional provided?</h3>
     Rate from 0% to 100%, where 0% means NOT INSTRUCTION PROVIDED; 10% VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND up to 100% meaning VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND RUN.<br>
     In case of a data set the question has to be answered considering 0% means NOT DATA FORMAT DESCRIPTION; 10% VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND THE DATA FORMAT up to 100% meaning VERY EASY TO UNDERSTAND AND USE THE DATA.

  <h3><li>Comment about the efforts to obtain, install, and use the artefact:</h3>
    E.g., very limited instructions were given; I abandoned at some point because it was not clear what to do; it was difficult to figure out what exactly are the steps to follow; easy to follow but some degree of familiarity is necessary; very simple step-by-step instructions have been provided; piece of cake, the authors provide a guide for dummies; I had nothing to do I just downloaded a VM image.

  <h3><li>If the artefact reached the "functional" level, meaning that it seems to function correctly, did the authors provide all of the information and meta-data needed for others to reuse the artefact?</h3>
      Rate from 0%  to 100%, where 0% means NO DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED; 10% DOCUMENTATION HARD TO UNDERSTAND up to 100% meaning DOCUMENTATION VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

  <h3><li>If the artefact reached the "functional" level, meaning that it seems to function correctly, can the artefact be easily reused and/or repurposed?</h3>
      Rate from 0%  to 100%, where 0% means IMPOSSIBLE TO REUSE; 10% VERY LIMITED REUSABILITY up to 100% meaning ARTEFACT VERY EASY TO REUSE/REPURPOSE.

  <h3><li>Comment about the degree of reusability/repurposing:</h3>
     E.g., I already have some ideas how to reuse it; the artefact does not sufficiently feature-rich to be reused; I can see opportunities to use it for; the artefact is functional but reusing it is kind of a hassle...

    <h3><li>Badge Recommendation based on th following ACM Badge definitions:</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Artefacts Available:</strong> Author-created artefacts relevant to this paper is publicly available. A DOI or link to this  repository along with a unique identifier for the object is provided.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <strong>Artefacts Evaluated â€“ Functional:</strong> The artefacts associated with the research are found to be documented, consistent, complete, exercisable, and include appropriate evidence of  verification and validation.
        </li><br>

        <li>
          <strong>Artefacts Evaluated â€“ Reusable:</strong> The artefacts associated with the paper are of a quality that      significantly exceeds minimal functionality. That is, they have all the qualities of the Artefacts Evaluated â€“ Functional level, but, in addition, they are very carefully documented and well-structured to the  extent that reuse and repurposing is facilitated. In particular, norms and standards of the research community for artefacts of this type are strictly adhered to.
