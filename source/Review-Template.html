General Information 


Type of Artefact:
 	[ ]  Dataset    
	[ ]  Script/Tools 
	[ ]  New Artefact
	[ ]  Extension of existing artefact

What is the degree of efforts to obtain the artefact? Rate from 0% to 100%, where 0% means NOT AVAILABLE; 10%, VERY HARD TO OBTAIN up to 100% meaning VERY EASY TO OBTAIN.

Comment about the degree of efforts to obtain the artefact (e.g., did the paper have explicit pointer to the artefact? The artefact is simply not available. I need to register to obtain the artefact. The artefact is a testbed and I cannot use it. The artefact is actually hardware, I cannot obtain it. The artefact is licensed and I should pay...):
[Text Box]

Do you consider that the nature of the artefact (or any component of it) may raise (non-technical) issues (e.g., ethical issues; non FRAND - Fair, Reasonable and Non Discriminatory - licenses; environmental issues; safety issues)? Of which Nature? 
[Text Box]

Has the artefact been deposited in what can be reasonably considered the most appropriate available repository, which ensures perennially availability? 
[Text  Box]

In relation to the previous point, how long do you expect or estimate the artefact will be available:
Less than one year
2 to 5 years
5 to 10 years
More than 10 years




Completeness of the Information 

Are the instructions on how to install and make the artefact functional provided? Rate from 0% to 100%, where 0% means NOT INSTRUCTION PROVIDED; 10% VERY HARD TO UNDERSTAND up to 100% meaning VERY EASY TO INSTALL AND RUN.

Comment about the efforts to obtain, install, and use the artefact (e.g., very limited instructions were given; I abandoned at some point because it was not clear what to do; it was difficult to figure out what exactly are the steps to follow; easy to follow but some degree of familiarity is necessary; very simple step-by-step instructions have been provided; piece of cake, the authors provide a guide for dummies; I had nothing to do I just downloaded a VM image):
[Text Box]

— Note — Question 1 must be worked out because for things like data sets and platforms it does not apply in the current form. Should be declined in different versions.

If the artefact reached the "functional" level, meaning that it seems to function correctly, did the authors provide all of the information and meta-data needed for others to reuse the artefact?  Rate from 0%  to 100%, where 0% means NO DOCUMENTATION PROVIDED; 10% DOCUMENTATION HARD TO UNDERSTAND up to 100% meaning DOCUMENTATION VERY CLEAR AND EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

Comment about the quality of the documentation (e.g., documentation is complete and clear; documentation is lacking fundamental explanations; authors even explain in details how to reproduce the paper; documentation is not provided; documentation is lacking the following basic information:….): 
[Text Box]

If the artefact reached the "functional" level, meaning that it seems to function correctly, can the artefact be easily reused and/or repurposed?  Rate from 0%  to 100%, where 0% means IMPOSSIBLE TO REUSE; 10% VERY LIMITED REUSABILITY up to 100% meaning ARTEFACT VERY EASY TO REUSE/REPURPOSE.

Comment about the degree of reusability/repurposing (e.g., I already have some ideas how to reuse it; the artefact does not sufficiently feature-rich to be reused; I can see opportunities to use it for: …..; the artefact is functional but reusing it is kind of a hassle):
